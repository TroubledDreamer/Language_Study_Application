# Language_Study_Application
## A group project for a study app to test reading and writing for various languages.

Introducing our innovative language learning solution! Our team has developed an interactive interface that acts as a comprehensive study application for anyone interested in learning different languages. Our interface focuses on Spanish and French and is designed to cater to learners of all proficiency levels. With separate categories for each language, our interface features a vast collection of questions that evaluate the user's spelling, vocabulary, and communication skills.
